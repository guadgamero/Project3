    <p>Here are some old art pieces.</p>
    <img src="p2images/twilightlaundromatandbowlingzone.png" alt="Twilight Laundromat and Bowling Zone"/>
    <p>This was art that I made with a friend in mind. They really like jackalopes and their nickname for me is Birdy, so that's why those two animals are there.</p>
    <p>The urge to draw washing machines was strange, but it's what inspired this piece. Also, I found out that bowling can be fun.</p>
    <img src="p2images/up10tionwooshin.png" alt="Golden Boy"/> 
    <p>This was fanart that I sent in to a show where one of my favorite artists were set to appear.</p>
    <p>However, their appearance was cancelled when one of their labelmates passed away since the artists were close.</p>
    <p>Still, it is a nice piece to pull out and look at from time to time since it's shiny. This effect was acheived using gold washi tape!</p>
    <img src="p2images/Sparky.png" alt="Dog Drawing"/>
    <p>I made this when my dog Sparky was curled up on the couch.</p>
    <p>He was really comfy up there for a long while so I managed to draw the whole thing in one sitting.</p>
    <p>Then I scanned it and cleaned it up digitally.</p>
    <img src="p2images/Witch_TheHouse_001.jpg" alt="A Witch's House"/>
    <p>This is the oldest piece here! I'm no architecture student so there aren't any truly straight lines. But, the house is supposed to have a dreamy or magical appearance.</p>
